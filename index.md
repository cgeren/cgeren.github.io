I am an undergraduate research assistant at Lehigh University's <a href="https://wordpress.lehigh.edu/sss/" target="_blank">Scalable Systems Software Lab</a> obtaining a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering and a B.A. in Mathematics.

<br />
As a computer scientist and mathematician, my research sits at the intersection of applied cryptography and systems software.

<br />
I aim to make certain cryptographic primitives such as zk-SNARKs more scalable to allow for an internet which is decentralized and trustless.
