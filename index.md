I am a research assistant at Lehigh University's<a href="https://wordpress.lehigh.edu/sss/" target="_blank">Scalable Systems Software Lab</a>.

<br />
As a computer scientist and mathematician, my research sits at the intersection of applied cryptography and systems software. I aim to make certain cryptographic primitives such as zk-SNARKs more scalable to allow for an internet which is decentralized and trustless.
